### What I learned

This design challenge has improve my knowledge in CSS - using flex to organise element in container and set box shadow.

```css
.attribution {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 16px;
    box-shadow: 8px 8px hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep learning the core part of HTML and CSS. Although, I'm already learning React, a frontend library, but I feel like knowing the core aspect of CSS and HTML because the are the foundation when it comes to web development if not software development.
